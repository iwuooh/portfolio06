                <h4>Avoid close contact with others.</h4>
                <p>It’s important to understand that the new coronavirus spreads mainly from person to person. If an infected person coughs or sneezes, their droplets can infect people nearby. That’s why it’s important to avoid close contact with others.</p>

                <h4>Practice good hygiene wherever you are.</h4>
                <p>The new coronavirus can survive for hours or even days on some surfaces. Touching a contaminated surface and then touching your face is one of the ways to become infected.
                   The virus is no longer detectable on plastic after 72 hours, and on stainless steel or cardboard after about 48 hours.</p>

                <p>My first advice is do not panic. It’s a completely unprecedented challenge for all of us, but there are fantastic people on the front lines of it in clinical medicine and in science and on the patient advocacy side and together, we will rise to the challenge on this. I think there is a rich history of patients and physicians and scientists coming together to solve these world-changing diseases. I’m thinking of polio and HIV and smallpox and malaria — we’ve been able to either defeat or control these diseases to the point that either they’re gone from humanity, like smallpox, or we’ve made them treatable and manageable, like malaria and HIV. We’ll get there.</p>

                <p>I’m jumping all over the clinical trial. If it’s me and they said you could potentially get this antiviral, which has shown to have some efficacy, I’m in. Do I want to be treated with hydroxychloroquine? I would not be looking at the internet for home remedies. If there is a clinical trial, I’m in. Specifically, if I can get in the Gilead trial with remdesivir, I’d probably really want to get in that one.With respect to medications, the big thing still with this disease is the medications are going to be helpful, but they’re not going to reach everybody. Now just from the scope of what we’re predicting for this disease in the next several months, these medications are not coming to market.</p>
