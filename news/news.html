                <h3>High temperature</h3>
                <p>This means you feel hot to touch on your chest or back (you do not need to measure your temperature.A fever is a body temperature that’s higher than is considered normal. It’s also called a high temperature, hyperthermia, or pyrexia, and it’s usually a sign that your body is working to keep you healthy from an infection. Normal body temperatures are different for everyone, but they lie within the range of 97 to 99. A temperature of 100.4 or higher is considered a fever.
                   A part of your brain called the hypothalamus controls your body temperature. In response to an infection, illness, or some other cause, the hypothalamus may reset the body to a higher temperature. So when a fever comes on, it’s a sign that something is going on in your body.We tend to think of normal body temperature as a static number, but in fact a person’s body temperature can vary throughout the day, says Georgine Nanos, M.D., a family physician and CEO of the Kind Health Group, a telemedicine service. Nor is there a single number that constitutes “normal” for everyone. Recent research has even found that the average body temperature has changed over the years. Scientists say it is now around 97.5° F, not 98.6° F.</p>

                <h3>New, continuous cough</h3>
                <p>This means coughing a lot for more than an hour, or 3 or more coughing episodes in 24 hours.A cough is supposed to protect you. It gets out stuff that doesn't belong in your lungs and windpipe, like inhaled dirt or food. Here are the common triggers.
                   Colds and the flu are the most common causes. While annoying, coughs that are “productive” get germy mucus out of your lungs when you're sick. Most will go away in a few days. After a cold, though, some "dry" coughs last weeks or months. That could be because coughing irritates your lungs, which leads to more coughing, which irritates your lungs, and so on.Basically, a dry cough is "one where no mucus or phlegm is produced with the cough," Subinoy Das, MD an Ohio-based ear nose and throat physician, and medical director for the US Institute for Advanced Sinus Care & Research, tells Health. Conversely, a wet cough "is one filled with mucus or phlegm where someone can actually feel the mucus move in their bronchi or throat," he says, adding that "mucus expectorates or leaves the chest with each [wet] cough."</p>

                <h3>Loss or change to your sense of smell or taste</h3>
                <p>This means you've noticed you cannot smell or taste anything, or things smell or taste different to normal.At this stage in the coronavirus outbreak, it's been well-documented that COVID-19 patients often experience a loss of taste and smell, usually as one of the first symptoms. For most people, these senses return to normal within several weeks. But others have noticed substantial changes to previously familiar odors and flavors, if their taste and smell come back at all.
                   While losing taste and smell happens often with viral infections and even other coronaviruses, the way that COVID-19 affects a patient's nose and mouth seems different, according to Dr. Sandeep Robert Datta, a Harvard neuroscientist who co-authored a recent study on anosmia, aka loss of smell, published in Science Advances.
                   "In many cases, the reason you lose your sense of smell when you get a cold is that your mucus composition changes, your nose gets super stuffy," he told TODAY. "When your cold resolves, that inflammation goes away and you can smell again. In COVID, it doesn't appear that that's the main thing going on."</p>
